## Award-winning writer and front-end developmer.  
I learned C and R in university, and have always messed around with HTML, but only really got serious about coding in 2020. I got back into it with Python and JavaScript through [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) and Udemy, and then stepped up my game in a big way and graduated from the Web Development bootcamp at [Juno College](https://junocollege.com/) in December 2020. I was a full-time developer from Jan 2021 to Apr 2022, and now I'm not, but I still take on a project occasionally.

## My portfolio:

## Non-coding stuff:
- Community building, communication, and project management skills aplenty. I co-founded [an events space in Toronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Double_Land), [wrote a book](https://bookhugpress.ca/shop/author/stephen-thomas/the-jokes-by-stephen-thomas/) that was [translated into French](http://tetepremiere.com/livre/cest-une-farce/), and co-created an [award-winning web series](https://www.one-tenproductions.com/).

## Get in touch!
I'm super social and always interested in meeting new people. Down to chat, collaborate.
