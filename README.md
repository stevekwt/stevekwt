### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Steve! (he/him)

## I'm transitioning from a career in writing to front-end development.  
I learned C and R in university, and have always messed around with HTML, but only really got serious about coding in 2020. I got back into it with Python and JavaScript through [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) and Udemy, and then stepped up my game in a big way and graduated from the Web Development bootcamp at [Juno College](https://junocollege.com/) in December 2020. **I'm now looking for work!**

## Post-bootcamp, I'm currently working on:
- Wes Bos's [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/)
- Cleaning up [my portfolio](https://stevecodes.com/)
- A quick refresher of my R knowledge with Justin Murphy's [Data Blogging with R](https://jmrphy.ck.page/data-blogging-mini-course)
- Finishing up a small [Python For Journalists](https://datajournalism.com/watch/python-for-journalists/) course I started pre-bootcamp through datajournalism.com.

## Next up:
- I plan on digging into the MERN stack to round out my front-end skills
- I fantasize about making all kinds of bespoke gadgets with Raspberry Pis, but that may have to wait till I'm gainfully employed :)

## Get in touch!
I'm super social and always interested in meeting new people. Down to chat, collaborate, and â€” did I mention **I'm looking for work**?
