### Hi there ðŸ‘‹&nbsp; I'm Steve! (he/him)

## Award-winning writer transitioning to front-end development.  
I learned C and R in university, and have always messed around with HTML, but only really got serious about coding in 2020. I got back into it with Python and JavaScript through [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) and Udemy, and then stepped up my game in a big way and graduated from the Web Development bootcamp at [Juno College](https://junocollege.com/) in December 2020. **I'm now looking for work!**

## Post-bootcamp, I'm currently working on:
- Vanilla JS fundamentals with Wes Bos's [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) | ðŸ—“ Day: **9**
- Cleaning up [my portfolio](https://stevecodes.com/)
- A quick refresher of my R knowledge with Justin Murphy's [Data Blogging with R](https://jmrphy.ck.page/data-blogging-mini-course)
- Finishing up a small [Python For Journalists](https://datajournalism.com/watch/python-for-journalists/) course I started pre-bootcamp through datajournalism.com.
- Making my way through Cormen/Leiserson/Rivest/Stein's 3rd edition of *Introduction to Algorithms*

## Next up:
- I plan on digging into the MERN stack to round out my front-end skills
- I fantasize about making all kinds of bespoke gadgets with Raspberry Pis, but that may have to wait till I'm gainfully employed :)

## I bring with me:
- Community building, communication, and project management skills aplenty. I co-created [an events space in Toronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Double_Land), [wrote a book](https://bookhugpress.ca/shop/author/stephen-thomas/the-jokes-by-stephen-thomas/) that was [translated into French](http://tetepremiere.com/livre/cest-une-farce/), and co-created an [award-winning web series](https://www.one-tenproductions.com/).

## Get in touch!
I'm super social and always interested in meeting new people. Down to chat, collaborate, and â€” did I mention **I'm looking for work**?
